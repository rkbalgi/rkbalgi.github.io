      <p>Welcome to my github pages. You will find here some link to interesting or amusing things I've read (or as a marker for myself).</p>

<p>I'm a software developer working at a large IT services company in Bangalore, India. I work for a payments/financial client based in the US (more of that at my linkedin account). I mostly work with and around the java ecosystem but, have dabbled with pretty much anything that's caught my attention (more recently scala, go).</p>
