### ISO8583

I have worked a long time in the payments space and you'll find that I've done quite a bit of work around ISO8583 messaging

 [isosim](https://github.com/rkbalgi/isosim) and [libiso](https://github.com/rkbalgi/libiso) are two Go projects that can be used for testing ISO8583 related things -
 * Define ISO8583 specifications
 * Define TCP servers/clients backing the specs
 * Define ISO8583 server logic based on fields like amount etc
 
 I have other GitHub repo's that do ISO8583 simulators/libraries in other languages like Java, JavaScript and Rust.  
 
 [https://github.com/rkbalgi/tcptester](https://github.com/rkbalgi/tcptester) is a Java library for TCP/IP load testing. I wrote this as a smaller alternative
 for JMeter based raw TCP testing.
