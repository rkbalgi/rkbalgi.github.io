Welcome to my github pages. You will find here some link to interesting or amusing things I've read (or as a marker for myself).

## About me
I'm a software developer working at a large IT services company in Bangalore, India. I work for a payments/financial client based in the US (more of that at my [linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/pub/raghavendra-balgi/4/ba0/58) account). I mostly work with and around the Java ecosystem but, have dabbled with pretty much anything that's caught my attention (more recently scala, go).
