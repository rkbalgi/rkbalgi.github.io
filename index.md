 ## ISO8583
 isosim and libiso are two Go projects that can be used for testing ISO8583 related things -
 * Define ISO8583 specifications
 * Define TCP servers/clients backing the specs
 * Define ISO8583 server logic based on fields like amount etc
 
 I have other GitHub repo's that do ISO8583 simulators/libraries in other languages like Java, JavaScript and Rust.  
 
 [https://github.com/rkbalgi/tcptester](https://github.com/rkbalgi/tcptester) is a Java library for TCP/IP load testing.
