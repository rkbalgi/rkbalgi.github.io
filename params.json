You will find here some link to interesting or amusing things I've read (or as a marker for myself).\r\n\r\n## about me\r\nI'm a software developer working at a large IT services company in Bangalore, India. I work for a payments/financial client based in the US (more of that at my [linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/pub/raghavendra-balgi/4/ba0/58) account). I mostly work with and around the java ecosystem but, have dabbled with pretty much anything that's caught my attention (more recently scala, go).\r\n\r\n## links\r\n1.
